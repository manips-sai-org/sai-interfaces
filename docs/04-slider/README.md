The `sai2-interfaces-slider` Element
====================================
The `sai2-interfaces-slider` element allows you to get/set the values of a 
scalar or vector tied to the Redis key.

## Usage
```
<sai2-interfaces-slider key="..." min="..." max="..." step="...">
</sai2-interfaces-slider>
```

If you specify a vector-valued key with `n` elements, `sai2-interfaces-slider` will create `n` sliders, one for each element.

## Attributes
* `key`: Required. The key for which to create a slider. Can be a scalar or vector.
* `display`: Optional. The friendly display name. If omitted, the default will be the `key`. If you have a vector-valued key, the name will be the value provided `display` plus an index, e.g. `display_name[0]`.
* `min`: Required. The minimum value for the scalar or vector. If you have a vector-valued key, you can specify a minimum value for each element in the vector.
* `max`: Required. The maximum value for the scalar or vector. If you have a vector-valued key, you can specify a maximum value for each element in the vector.
* `step`: Required. The amount to increment the slider value by when you drag the slider. If you have a vector-valued key, you can specify the step for each element in the vector.

## Example
Since sliders can handle both scalar-valued and vector-valued Redis keys, let's do two examples. We'll start a scalar key called `sai2::interfaces::tutorial::scalar_key` and set it to `5`.

Similarly, we'll create a vector key called `sai2::interfaces::tutorial::vector_key` and set it to `[3,4]`. 

Writing this into Redis:
```
wjen@wjen-desktop:~/sai2/core/sai2-interfaces$ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> set sai2::interfaces::tutorial::scalar_key 5
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> set sai2::interfaces::tutorial::vector_key [3,4]
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> get sai2::interfaces::tutorial::scalar_key
"5"
127.0.0.1:6379> get sai2::interfaces::tutorial::vector_key
"[3,4]"
127.0.0.1:6379> 
```

### Scalar Example
Let's limit our scalar key to be between 0 and 10. Let's say the step size is 1, and we'll give a friendly name while we're at it. This HTML should look like this:
```
<sai2-interfaces-slider key="sai2::interfaces::tutorial::scalar_key"
  display="scalar_key" min="0" max="10" step="1">
</sai2-interfaces-slider>
```

Let's start up the server now.
```
wjen@wjen-desktop:~/sai2/core/sai2-interfaces$ python3 interface/server.py docs/04-slider/04-slider.html 
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 142-257-956
(31058) wsgi starting up on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Open your browser to `localhost:8000`, and you should see something like this:

![scalar slider initial](./scalar-slider.png)

You can drag the slider back and forth, use your mouse wheel to increment or decrement the value, and also manually input what value you want in the input textbox.

That's pretty much it for scalar values!

### Vector Example

Let's limit each element in the vector be between 0 and 10, and the step size to be 1 for each element. With a friendly name, our HTML for a vector-valued key should look like this:
```
<sai2-interfaces-slider key="sai2::interfaces::tutorial::vector_key"
  display="vector" min="0" max="10" step="1">
</sai2-interfaces-slider>
```

Edit the [04-slider.html](./04-slider.html) file with the new HTML, and if you still have the server running from the scalar key part, refresh the page. If not, launch the server using the above command in the Scalar Example section.

Your new interface should look like this:

![vector-valued slider with const min/max/step](./slider-vector-const.png)

Try moving the sliders - you will see that each element has the same minimum, maximum, and step value.

However, what if we want to give each element a custom name, minimum value, maximum value, and step? We can do this by revising our HTML as following:
```
<sai2-interfaces-slider key="sai2::interfaces::tutorial::vector_key"
  display='["Apples","Bananas"]' min="[1,2]" max="[5,6]" step="[0.5,1]">
</sai2-interfaces-slider>
```

After editing the HTML, reloading, and messing with the sliders, you could get output like this:
